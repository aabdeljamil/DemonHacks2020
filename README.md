# DemonHacks2020 Submission

This past year with the pandemic raging on nationwide, schools and the government have decided to transition to virtual classes. The most common platforms being used are Zoom, Webex, and Blackboard Collaborate Ultra. While these platforms were created for the purpose of conducting meetings and classes, they lack a very important aspect of a class: formality. Students do not treat online classes like traditional classes, especially in middle school and high school classes. Instructors often struggle with moderation of their classes, participation tracking and participation encouragement, and engaging activities. To solve this common, ongoing problem, my team decided to try to implement a class environment in Discord, which is usually used for gaming. What we noticed in Discord is that it has all features that Zoom or related platforms would have, such as screen-sharing, and more. Its GUI is very user-friendly and easy to navigate which is great for both students and instructors. The most important feature of Discord, however, is the implementation of bots. Most Discord servers often contain bots to assist in many things such as moderation, music, and even memes. We made a Discord bot that has many features and commands to assist instructors in the above problems, which will hopefully increase the interest in Discord being used by schools/instructors as a class environment.
